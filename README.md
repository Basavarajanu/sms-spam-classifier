Spam Detection Project
Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model for spam detection. The aim is to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham) using natural language processing techniques and supervised learning algorithms.

Explore the notebooks:

Use Jupyter notebooks in notebooks/ to explore the dataset, preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
Train the model:

Navigate to src/ and run the scripts for training and evaluating models.
Evaluate the model:

Once trained, evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Make predictions:

Use the trained model to make predictions on new email data.
Model Selection
The project explores various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer-based models for text classification.
Results
Describe the results of the trained models and their performance metrics.
